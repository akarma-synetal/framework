'@objectstack/plugin-auth': patch
---

Add explicit `@better-auth/core` dependency.

`plugin-auth` already pulled `@better-auth/core` transitively via `@better-auth/oauth-provider`, but several call sites in `auth-manager.ts` import from it directly. Promote it to a first-class dependency so the resolved version is stable across the workspace and `pnpm install` doesn't surface "module not found" against the transitive copy under stricter peer resolution.

No behaviour change.
