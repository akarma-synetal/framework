**Driver-level tenant isolation for objects with `organization_id`.**

`SqlDriver` now auto-applies a `WHERE organization_id = :tenantId` predicate on every read/update/delete and auto-injects the column on insert when the caller passes `options.tenantId` and the object schema declares an `organization_id` field. `bulkCreate`, `bulkDelete`, `updateMany`, `deleteMany`, `count` and `aggregate` are all scoped.

ObjectQL's engine now threads `ExecutionContext.tenantId` into the driver options for every CRUD entry point (including `expandRelatedRecords`), so a tenant-scoped session can no longer cross tenants — even through lookup expansion or count fallbacks.

Backward compatible: callers that omit `tenantId` (system tasks, seed scripts) keep getting unscoped behaviour. Explicit `organization_id` on an insert row always wins over the contextual `tenantId` so admin tooling can still target a specific tenant.

13 new tests in `sql-driver-tenant-scope.test.ts` verify cross-tenant find/findOne/update/delete/count/bulkCreate/updateMany/deleteMany isolation, the unscoped admin path, and that global objects (no `organization_id`) are not scoped.
